These are supplement files for the NEURON model used in my PLoSCB 2017 manuscript.<br>
To run the model, type `nrngui` in commandline to run [the NEURON simulator][1]. Type in or copy paste the command from `main.hoc` line by line. So you can visualize the voltage from soma section.<br>

All ion conductance parameters are in 'params.txt'. The morphology of the pyramidal cell can be retrieved from n400td-pc2-sp-axn.hoc.
